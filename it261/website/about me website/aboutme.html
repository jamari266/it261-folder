<h2> About Me:</h2>
<p> Hello, my name is Ja'Mari Adams. I was born and raised in Seattle Washington and I graduated from Chief Sealth High School in 2010.
Since High School I have received a certificate of information technology through a program called YearUp. 
I enjoy spending time with friends, playing videos games and trying new foods.
 I have always wanted to figure out how computers and the Internet worked and when I found out about the YearUp program it gave me a chance to explore into the information technology field.
